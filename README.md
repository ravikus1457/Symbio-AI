# Symbio AI — Website

The Symbio AI marketing site, built as a clean, dependency-light **static site** with
[Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) and Nunjucks templating. The header, footer, design
system, and scripts are each written **once** and reused across every page. The output in
`dist/` is plain HTML/CSS/JS with **no client-side framework runtime** — it hosts trivially on
any static host (Cloudflare tunnel, GitHub Pages, a Raspberry Pi) by simply serving the folder.

> Brand: **Symbio AI** — _“We catch and convert leads in real time.”_
> Built by Mohammed & Ravi.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install        # install dev dependencies
npm run dev        # local dev server with live reload (http://localhost:8080)
npm run build      # produce the static site in ./dist
npm run lint       # HTMLHint + Stylelint + ESLint
npm run format     # Prettier (CSS / JS / JSON / MD)
```

Requires Node 18+ (developed on Node 22).

```

Eleventy only treats `.njk` files as templates; CSS, JS, images, and `chatbot-demo.html` are
copied through verbatim. Links between pages are **relative** (`about.html`, `pricing.html`, …)
so the built site works from any subpath.

---

## Design system

One stylesheet — `src/assets/css/styles.css` — is the single source of truth. All colors,
spacing, radii, shadows, type, and motion are CSS custom properties, organized into clearly
commented sections.

- **Light _and_ dark mode** via CSS variables. The theme is set **before first paint** by a
  tiny inline script in `<head>` to avoid a flash. A toggle in the header flips it and persists
  the choice in `localStorage` under the key **`symbio-theme`**; with no stored choice the OS
  preference (`prefers-color-scheme`) governs.
- **Mobile-first & responsive**, with a clean collapsing mobile menu.
- **Honors `prefers-reduced-motion`** — the rotating hero word, drifting aurora, and live lead
  feed all degrade to a static populated state; reveal-on-scroll content is shown immediately.
- Accessible: landmarks, skip link, visible focus states, `aria-current` on the active nav
  item, labelled controls, and sufficient contrast in both themes.

### The living hero

The home hero is one orchestrated moment: a headline whose last word cycles through outcomes
(booked leads → booked calls → new clients → real revenue), a soft drifting gradient aurora,
and a live “lead inbox” where leads slide in, a typing indicator resolves to **Replied/Booked**,
and a counter ticks up. Animation **pauses when the tab is hidden** and is replaced by a static
populated state under reduced motion.

## Deploying `dist/`

`npm run build` writes a self-contained static site to `dist/`. Serve that folder anywhere:

**Any static host / your own box**

```bash
npm run build
cd dist && python3 -m http.server 8080   # or any static file server
```

**Cloudflare Tunnel** (serve the folder, then expose it)

```bash
npm run build
npx serve dist            # or: cd dist && python3 -m http.server 8080
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080
```

**GitHub Pages** — push the contents of `dist/` to your Pages branch/folder. Because all links
are relative, it also works from a project subpath (e.g. `user.github.io/repo/`).

**Raspberry Pi / nginx** — copy `dist/` to the web root (e.g. `/var/www/html`) and serve it
statically. No Node.js runtime is needed in production.

## The embeddable chat widget

`src/assets/js/symbio-widget.js` is a **standalone, dependency-free** assistant that drops onto
**any** website with a single `<script>` tag. It renders inside a **Shadow DOM**, so the host
page’s CSS can’t break it and its styles can’t leak out. It’s shipped as its own file (and
`symbio-widget.min.js`) and is **not bundled** into the site build.

The marketing site dogfoods it: `base.njk` loads the widget on every page exactly the way a
customer would (one `<script>` tag + `window.SymbioConfig`), branded for Symbio. There,
`main.js` bridges captured leads to the same scan endpoint as the form and keeps the widget’s
theme in step with the site’s light/dark toggle.

### Install

Configure with `window.SymbioConfig` **or** `data-*` attributes on the script tag (data-\*
wins):

```html
<script>
  window.SymbioConfig = {
    businessName: "Glow Salon",
    accent: "#1f6bff",
    services: ["Haircut", "Color", "Beard trim"],
    hours: "Tue–Sat, 9am–6pm",
    location: "Oakland, CA",
    phone: "510-555-0100",
    price: "From $35",
    position: "right", // "right" | "left"
    theme: "auto", // "auto" (follow the OS) | "light" | "dark"
    leadEndpoint: "", // optional, see contracts below
    aiEndpoint: "", // optional, see contracts below
    onLead: function (lead) {
      console.log("captured", lead);
    },
  };
</script>
<script src="symbio-widget.js" defer></script>
```

Quick setup via attributes:

```html
<script
  src="symbio-widget.js"
  data-business-name="Glow Salon"
  data-accent="#e0457b"
  data-services="Haircut, Color, Beard trim"
  data-hours="Tue–Sat, 9am–6pm"
  data-phone="510-555-0100"
  defer
></script>
```

### Behavior & API

- Built-in **intent engine** (hours, location, pricing, services, contact) and a deterministic
  **lead-capture flow** (name → contact → detail) that works with **zero backend**.
- Every captured lead fires a `window` **`symbio:lead`** event (`event.detail` is the lead) and
  calls `config.onLead(lead)`.
- **Theme:** `auto` follows the visitor’s OS; pass `light`/`dark` (or call `configure({ theme })`)
  to pin it — that’s how the site keeps the widget in sync with its toggle. A theme change never
  resets the conversation; a branding change (name/accent/services/…) re-greets.
- Public API:

  ```js
  window.SymbioWidget.open();
  window.SymbioWidget.close();
  window.SymbioWidget.toggle();
  window.SymbioWidget.configure({ businessName, accent, services, theme /* … */ }); // live update
  ```

> The minified build is produced with `npm run minify:widget`. The full-page demo at
> `chatbot-demo.html` inlines a copy of the widget so it stays shareable as a single file —
> keep that copy in sync with `src/assets/js/symbio-widget.js` if you change the widget.

## Backend contracts

These are implemented client-side; a backend developer only needs to honor them.

### 1. Free-scan form (`scan.html`)

On submit, the form POSTs JSON to:

| Host                       | Endpoint                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `localhost` / `127.0.0.1`  | `http://127.0.0.1:8878/api/free-scan`                                     |
| anything else (production) | `https://instances-sie-book-appointments.trycloudflare.com/api/free-scan` |

**Body** (JSON):

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "business": "",
  "email": "",
  "phone": "",
  "link": "",
  "need": "",
  "budget": "",
  "goal": "",
  "problem": "",
  "sourceUrl": ""
}
```

**Success** = HTTP `200` **and** a body of `{"ok": true}`. On any other response, a network
error, or a CORS failure, the form falls back to a pre-filled **mailto** to
`hmajeed04@gmail.com` (cc `ravikus1457@gmail.com`).

### 2. Widget lead delivery — `leadEndpoint` (optional)

```
POST <leadEndpoint>
{ "name", "contact", "detail", "business", "page", "at" }   ->   HTTP 200
```

Best-effort; the `symbio:lead` event and `onLead` callback fire regardless of delivery.

### 3. Widget AI replies — `aiEndpoint` (optional)

```
POST <aiEndpoint>
{ "messages": [{ "role": "user|assistant", "content": "…" }], "system": "…" }
->
{ "reply": "…" }
```

If `aiEndpoint` is unset or the request fails, the widget gracefully falls back to the built-in
intent engine. Lead capture is always deterministic and does not depend on the AI.

## Tooling

| Script                  | What it does                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`           | Eleventy dev server with live reload                     |
| `npm run build`         | Build the static site to `dist/`                         |
| `npm run clean`         | Remove `dist/`                                           |
| `npm run lint`          | Stylelint + ESLint + HTMLHint (HTMLHint runs on `dist/`) |
| `npm run format`        | Prettier write (CSS / JS / JSON / MD)                    |
| `npm run minify:widget` | Regenerate `symbio-widget.min.js` with Terser            |

Nunjucks templates and the self-contained `chatbot-demo.html` are excluded from Prettier
(its HTML parser rewrites `{% %}`/`{{ }}` tags) — they are hand-formatted and validated by
HTMLHint instead. Run `npm run build` before `npm run lint`, since HTMLHint lints the built
HTML in `dist/`.
